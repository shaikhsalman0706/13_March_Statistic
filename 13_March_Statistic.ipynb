    "#### ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to compare means between more than two groups. ANOVA relies on several assumptions to ensure the validity of its results.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The main assumptions of ANOVA are:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 1. Normality: The data should follow a normal distribution within each group.\n",
    "###### 2. Homogeneity of variance: The variance of each group should be equal.\n",
    "###### 3. Independence: The observations should be independent of each other.\n",
    "###### 4. Random sampling: The data should be collected through a random sampling process.\n",
    "###### 5. Equal sample sizes: The sample sizes for each group should be equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### If any of these assumptions are violated, it could impact the validity of the results. Some examples of violations that could impact the validity of the results are:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 1. Non-normality: If the data is not normally distributed, the results may be invalid. For example, if the data is skewed or has outliers, ANOVA may not be appropriate. In such cases, non-parametric tests may be more appropriate.\n",
    "###### 2. Heteroscedasticity: If the variance is not equal across groups, the results may be biased. For example, if one group has a much larger variance than the others, ANOVA may not be appropriate.\n",
    "###### 3. Autocorrelation: If the observations are not independent of each other, the results may be biased. For example, if the same individual is observed multiple times, the observations may be correlated.\n",
    "###### 4. Non-random sampling: If the data is not collected through a random sampling process, the results may be biased. For example, if individuals are selectively chosen to participate in the study, the results may not be generalizable to the entire population.\n",
    "###### 5. Unequal sample sizes: If the sample sizes for each group are not equal, the results may be biased. For example, if one group has a much larger sample size than the others, ANOVA may not be appropriate.\n",
    "#### It is important to check for violations of these assumptions before conducting ANOVA and to address them if they are present. This can be done through visual inspection of the data, statistical tests, or transformations of the data."

    "\n",
    "###### One-way ANOVA: One-way ANOVA is used when we want to compare the means of more than two groups for a single independent variable (also known as a factor). For example, we may want to compare the average test scores of students who attended different schools, with each school representing a different group. One-way ANOVA determines if there is a significant difference in the means of the groups and which groups are significantly different from each other.\n",

    "###### Two-way ANOVA: Two-way ANOVA is used when we want to investigate the effects of two independent variables (also known as factors) on a dependent variable. For example, we may want to investigate the effect of both age and gender on exam scores. Two-way ANOVA determines whether each independent variable has a significant effect on the dependent variable, as well as whether there is an interaction effect between the two independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Repeated measures ANOVA: Repeated measures ANOVA is used when we want to compare the means of two or more groups that are measured repeatedly over time or under different conditions. For example, we may want to compare the effectiveness of three different treatments for a medical condition, with each patient receiving all three treatments over time. Repeated measures ANOVA determines whether there is a significant difference in the means of the groups and which groups are significantly different from each other, while accounting for the correlation between repeated measurements."

    "#### In ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), the partitioning of variance refers to the process of decomposing the total variation in the response variable into its components, which can be attributed to different sources or factors. The goal of ANOVA is to determine whether the mean values of the response variable differ significantly across different levels of one or more factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### There are three types of variances in ANOVA: the total variance, the between-group variance, and the within-group variance. The total variance is the total variation in the response variable, which can be partitioned into the variance between the groups and the variance within the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The between-group variance represents the variation in the response variable that is explained by the differences between the groups, which can be attributed to the effect of the factor(s) being studied. The within-group variance, on the other hand, represents the variation in the response variable that is not explained by the differences between the groups, which can be attributed to the random variability within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the partitioning of variance is important because it helps to determine the significance of the factor(s) being studied in explaining the variation in the response variable. If the between-group variance is much larger than the within-group variance, it suggests that the factor(s) have a significant effect on the response variable. On the other hand, if the within-group variance is much larger than the between-group variance, it suggests that the factor(s) have little or no effect on the response variable.\n",

Using listwise deletion may result in a loss of statistical power and biased estimates if the missing data are not MCAR.

Imputation methods can introduce bias if the imputation model is misspecified, but can be more efficient and reduce bias if the imputation model is correctly specified. Therefore, the choice of the missing data handling method should be based on the type of missing data and the research question. It is recommended to perform sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of different missing data handling methods on the results."

They randomly select 30 days and record the sales for each store on those days. Conduct a repeated measures ANOVA using Python to determine if there are any significant differences in sales between the three stores. If the results are significant, follow up with a post-hoc test to determine which store(s) differ significantly from each other."
